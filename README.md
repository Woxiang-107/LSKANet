# LSKANet: Long Strip Kernel Attention Network for Robotic Surgical Scene Segmentation
by Min Liu, Yubin Han, Jiazheng Wang, Can Wang, Yaonan Wang, and Erik Meijering.
## Introduction
* We proposed a surgical scene segmentation network named **Long Strip Kernel Attention network (LSKANet)**, which includes two newly designed modules, **Dual-block Large Kernel Attention module (DLKA)** and **Multiscale Affinity Feature Fusion module (MAFF)**. Besides, the hybrid loss with **Boundary Guided Head (BGH)** is proposed to help the network segment indistinguishable boundaries effectively. Our LSKANet achieves new state-of-the-art results on three datasets with different surgical scenes (Endovis2018, CaDIS, and MILS) with relative improvements of 2.6%, 1.5%, and 3.4% mIoU, respectively.
